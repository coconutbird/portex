Refactor: Section-owned data architecture + layout engine

Major refactoring for proper PE rewriting support:

- Section struct now owns its data (Vec<u8>) instead of pointing into monolithic buffer
- Added layout.rs with alignment utilities and section layout calculation
- PE::build() properly recalculates all offsets and sizes before writing
- PE::update_layout() for recalculating section RVAs and file offsets
- Added section manipulation: add_section(), remove_section()
- SectionHeader now has contains_rva(), rva_to_offset() helpers
- Section has data_at_rva(), data_at_rva_mut() for RVA-based access
- PEHeaders renamed section field to section_headers for clarity
- 25 unit tests passing
